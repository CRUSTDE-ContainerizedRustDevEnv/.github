## dash vs underscore madness

GitHub does not allow underscores in the Organization name or Username.  
This is because underscore cannot be used in internet domain names or subdomain names.  
But it is allowed in repository names.  
I prefer using underscore because of Rust naming conventions.  
I will use underscore everywhere except where is not possible. There I will convert them to dashes or remove them.  

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
